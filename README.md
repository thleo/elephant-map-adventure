Learning Hadoop and requisites
***
Hello there! 

I've wanted to really dive into data science and as part of my journey on becoming a better data scientist, I'm learning to work with Hadoop and Scala.

I find that I learn best by doing so I'm writing notes on what resources I have found to be most helpful in a **learn by doing** approach.

If you have any suggestions or thoughts on how the notes could be better formatted or I've made a mistake in a code block, feel free to let me know!

### My current setup
I run a windows 10 personal computer at home with something like 
- 700 GB of storage 
- 16 gb or so of RAM
- i5 processor

I have a linux partition I am using for running hadoop
- linux mint, cinnamon 18.x
- always running things as `super`

*Quick Note:* If you forget your root/admin password, you can google "Lost linux password." 

I found [**this**](https://community.linuxmint.com/tutorial/view/1355) tutorial to be most helpful. I might have been misreading previous tutorials but you have to replace the text starting at `ro...` and ending at `...handoff`.
